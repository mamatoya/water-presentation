LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The lands that comprise present-day Mesa are culturally affiliated with the O'odham, Piipaash, and their ancestors.

The City of Mesa acknowledges that we gather on the homeland of the Native people and their ancestors, who have inhabited this landscape from time immemorial to the present day.

The Hohokam people prototyped the basis for our modern canal infrastructure, pumping the lifeblood of the land's natural rivers through arroyos, connecting civilization to lush abundance.

================================================================================

PROJECT VISION

Our Vision:
To create awareness and action around water sustainability in Arizona through immersive, educational experiences that connect communities to the lifeblood of their landscape.

What Change Will Occur?
- Increased public awareness of water scarcity issues
- Community engagement with local water policy
- Connection between technology, industrial growth, and water resources
- Advocacy for sustainable practices and gradual utility rate adjustments

================================================================================

THE CHALLENGE: WATER SCARCITY IN THE DESERT

Critical Issues:
- Growing population in an arid desert climate
- Industrial activities: Data centers, semiconductors, chip factories
- 85% of water used for industrial purposes
- Loss of keystone flora and fauna species

Data center power demand will grow 160% by 2030

AI-driven workloads are accelerating data center growth, using extensive amounts of water for cooling systems, rendering it contaminated and improperly recycled.

================================================================================

STATUS QUO

- Citizens remain unaware of the water crisis
- Data centers built on historically indigenous and Hispanic communities
- Utility rates will increase 30% with "rate shock"
- Natural environments continue to be devastated
- Colorado River resources further depleted

================================================================================

CONNECTING THROUGH EXPERIENCE

What Distinguishes Our Approach?
- Immersive storytelling through multi-sensory experiences
- Historical narrative from Hohokam canals to modern infrastructure
- Spatial audio and binaural beats to create emotional impact
- Visual representations of water systems as human veins

Making the invisible visible - helping people understand that when they turn on the tap, there's a complex story of history, infrastructure, policy, and threatened resources behind that water.

================================================================================

OUR APPROACH

ancient water stewardship → industrialization → impact → taking water agency

Visual: Touch Designer & Pixera projections showing:
- Human water veins superimposed with canal systems
- Lost/endangered desert ecosystems
- Historical progression: Hohokam → Mormon settlers → SRP → Modern data centers

Audio: Spatial sound design with transitions from flowing water to server humming

Scent: Creosote diffuser to evoke desert environment

Interactive: Live water feature that gradually dries up during the presentation

================================================================================

ROAD MAP

Short-term Goals (2025):
- Create compelling immersive experience at ReMIX showcase
- Immerse 100+ attendees in the history and future of water
- Generate actionable awareness

Long-term Goals (2030):
- Inspire public to contact state representatives
- Advocate for sustainable data center regulations
- Support gradual utility rate increases to avoid "rate shock"
- Promote public spaces around canals with better maintenance
- Connect communities to nature and water resources

================================================================================

SOLUTIONS & ACCOUNTABILITY

What Can Be Done?

Industry Accountability: Kick off Arizona net zero water impact policy, modeling Google's stewardship, and hold industry accountable to create water replenishment

Education: Make water policy information approachable and engaging

Community Design: Have industry reinvest into outdoor publicly accessible areas, transforming canals into public spaces with shade structures, surf parks, and tree-lined pathways
